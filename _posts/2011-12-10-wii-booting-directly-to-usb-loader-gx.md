With a combination of Priiloader and USB Loader GX&#8217;s dol file, I managed to get USB Loader GX to boot at the Wii startup. It also goes back to USB Loader after a reset. It is using the custom theme with the Wii&#8217;s System Menu music. It should be as easy of having your games on a HDD and see them on your home menu. You hear that Nintendo? You may want to implement that in your Wii U.
