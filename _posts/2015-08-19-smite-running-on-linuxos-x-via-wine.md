For a while, [years] now, there have been attempts to run Smite under Wine. Unfortunately, the 
launcher could never get past waiting for that HiRez patch service. If your are just interested in 
getting Smite running in Wine check out [WineHQ]. If you want to go the PlayOnLinux 
(POL)/PlayOnMac route, I have created a POL script that should get you up and running. You can 
find the script ~~in a [gist]~~ on [GitHub]. Details are avaliable in the repo's readme.

Edit (16 Jan 2015): Moved scripts to a regular GitHub repo.
