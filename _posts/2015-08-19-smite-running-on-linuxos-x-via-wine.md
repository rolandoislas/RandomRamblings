For a while, [For a while,](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=27920) now, there have been attempts to run Smite under Wine. Unfortunately, the launcher could never get past waiting for that HiRez patch service. If your are just interested in getting Smite running in Wine check out [WineHQ](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=31936). If you want to go the PlayOnLinux (POL)/PlayOnMac route, I have created a POL script that should get you up and running. You can find the script in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/rolandoislas/92edb90a9b130ca076d1), or keep reading.
