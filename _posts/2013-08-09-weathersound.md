I am pleased to announce that [Weather Sound](http://weathersound.com "Weather Sound") is complete., that is, complete enough for me to release it. It does need refinements, but it is functional and looks somewhat like what I had imagined.<!--more-->

Weather Sound takes the user entered city and polls for weather data. That data is then used to display a weather scene based on that city&#8217;s weather conditions. For users who do not wish to enter a specific city and only want to select a scene, there is a scene selector.

Weather Sound relies on HTML5 video and audio tags, and there will be no support for IE 8 or below.
