Warzone 2100 is a RTS game that I was recently told about. I have only played the initial tutorial, but it looks interesting. The screenshots of the game depict different maps that seems as though they would be fun to play. Anyway, seeing that there was no precompiled Linux binary I decided to make one. I&#8217;m sure other people have compiled the binaries and released them, but here is another one.

<!--more-->

&nbsp;

Specifics:

  * Version 3.1.0
  * Contains only the base files. (Video files can be downloaded [here](http://wz2100.net/download).)
  * Install script for the video resources that are downloaded. I call it an install script, but it really just moves the files to the appropriate directory.

I will possibly compile future versions and upload them if anyone requests it.

[Download](http://www.mediafire.com/download/agu8gl2yv398ucz/warzone2100-3.1.0-compiled-linux.tar.gz "Warzone2100 3.1") (3.1.0)

Update: New versions will be added below.
