<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m giving away &#8220;Don&#8217;t Starve&#8221;. This is yet another giveaway, but this time I&#8217;m doing it through Steamgifts.com. Instead of just posting the code like I did in my previous giveaway, I will be using steamgifts to pick the winner. Check out the giveaway </span><a style="text-align: left;" title="Don't Starve Giveaway" href="http://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/MF4tO/dont-starve">here</a><span style="text-align: left;">. You must register on their website to enter the giveaway, but it is worth it. There are plenty of other giveaways there and if you ever want to host your own, you have that option. I watched a few Let&#8217;s Plays of this game and played the demo, which was good enough to get me to buy it. Hopefully you&#8217;ll enjoy this game too.</span>

  Game Description
</h1>

[Don&#8217;t Starve](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/) is a survival type build &#8217;em up game. I think that&#8217;s the correct way to describe it. You explore the world, collect resources, craft, research, fight monsters at night. Wait, is this Minecraft? No, but it is a great game that I am apparently failing to explain (Minecraft?).

Quote from the Don&#8217;t Starve Website

> Play as Wilson, an intrepid Gentleman Scientist who has been trapped by a demon and transported to a mysterious wilderness world. Wilson must learn to exploit his environment and its inhabitants if he ever hopes to escape and find his way back home. Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play your way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land.
