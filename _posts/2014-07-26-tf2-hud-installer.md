Many TF2 HUDs make use of GitHub or similar git hosting services, and while it is easy to obtain an archive manually or pull from the repo, some may not want to go through the trouble. With this in mind I decided to create a TF2 HUD Installer that offers a one click install of a TF2 HUD from a repo hosted on GitHub (I may expand support for other services.).<!--more-->

### **HUD Authors**

You can get the source (Java) at:Â [https://github.com/rolandoislas/TF2-Hud-Installer](https://github.com/rolandoislas/TF2-Hud-Installer "TF2 HUD Installer"). The README should cover the required configuration. If you are the repo owner and have no idea how to compile the installer [contact me](http://rolandoislas.com/blog/contact/ "Contact") and I may be able to compile it for you.
