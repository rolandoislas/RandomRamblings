If you are a Mac OS X user I am sure you have seen this windows before. You may have even stared Â at this screen waiting for the progress bar to move. With Mountain Lion Apple has now integrated software update into the App Store. Now before you start cheering, you should note that it still takes the same time and you get to stare at a loading wheel instead of the progress bar. Isn&#8217;t that great?

  I could find 100 updates in Ubuntu&#8217;s update manager in the time it takes to find one in OS X.
