I like Mountain Lion&#8217;s new dock, but I do not like how bright it is. Like all docks in OS X it is still a light gray and very bright. It is especially bright considering that i am using a solid black background.

Apple has changed the dock so that is no longer using PNG image files. It is now using Core Graphics. Damn you Apple! I don&#8217;t want your ridiculously bright dock and know I can&#8217;t change it. Hopefully the team over at Panic.com will figure it out when Mountain Lion releases.
