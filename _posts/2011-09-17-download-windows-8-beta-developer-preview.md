Microsoft has released three versions of its windows 8 developer preview. It is supposed to be able to boot in 8 seconds, but I have not gotten a chance to test it yet. At first I did not like the UI, but it looks a little better now. I&#8217;ll be installing on a separate partition  to test it out.

This is a developer preview so it will be unstable. I would not recommend using it as your main operating system. Install to a different partition or use a virtual machine to run it.
