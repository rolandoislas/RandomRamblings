I tried Jaffa Cakes after hearing about them constantly from the Yogscast, well mostly Simon of the Yogscast. I ordered them from amazon and considering I&#8217;m from the US it only took 8 days to arrive. They were melted upon arrival, so I put them in the fridge and let the chocolate harden. When they were finally ready to eat i took a bite and was repulsed by the flavor. Whose idea was it to to mix the orange and chocolate flavor?

My suggestion is to never buy Jaffa Cakes unless of course you have a hungry pet or give them as a gift to someone you hate.

**<span style="color: #ff2603;">To Simon of the Yogscast and anyone who enjoys Jaffa Cakes, what is wrong with you?</span>**

**Update:** After the second Jaffa Cake I realized I was wrong. They just take some getting used to. The chocolate flavor mixed with the orange jelly was tangy and delightful once my taste buds had a second exposure. I am happy to say I will be ordering more Jaffa cakes from Amazon.
