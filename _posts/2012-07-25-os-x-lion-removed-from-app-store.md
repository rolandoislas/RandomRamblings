The &#8220;world&#8217;s most advanced desktop operating system&#8221; was released today (Which does not deserve that title considering that it is getting simpler to fit the needs of the consumer). OS X Mountain Lion replaced it predecessor today. OS X Lion is no longer available in the app store. According to an Apple discussion forum, it is available for people who have already purchased it, but anyone looking to upgrade to it instead of Mountain Lion will not be able to. Apple you may have just drove a few Macintosh users to torrents. That&#8217;s right, anyone who wants Lion, but can&#8217;t upgrade to it because it is not available on the App Store will have to go to a torrent.

This screenshot was taken today July 25 at 1:12 AM MST. This is the list of the top paid Apps in the App Store. Lion held the number one top paid app for a long time and I barely noticed that it had fallen to second when I took the screenshot.

This screenshot was taken on July 25 10:58 AM MST. Mountain Lion had already been released and took the number one paid app spot. From the list you can see that OS X Lion should have just gone down to third, but it was removed. A search for Lion in the App Store only reveals Mountain Lion and third party apps.
