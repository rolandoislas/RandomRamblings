Sight is a futuristic video made that goes into the crystal ball to show us the way that we will see the future. Umm? Ok, that sentence is a bit ambiguous. Let me clarify. Sight is a video that shows a prediction of how a human&#8217;s sight might be in the future. Better? This video was made as an Academy of Arts project. It is fascinating and shows the way the future could be, provided that the technology can catch up to the predictions.

\[Spoiler Alert\] (It&#8217;s an eight minute video; do you really care?)

I think that the technology would be great if it were not permanent. If it were only a device like a computer or phone that you could put down or turn off, then there would be no (slightly less) problems. In the video the woman states that &#8220;Sight&#8221; (future eye technology) went down and she could not see. From that statement I am assuming that it is permanent. If the Sight servers go down for some reason, then everyone is blind. That includes the Sight developers. So, now everyone is blind and running into walls,

The benefits may be great, but seeing as I am horrible at most video games I would not be able to cook my own food. Yeah, so that may not be true. The interface they were showing was probably just a game that uses a real life activity tied in with the technology. There&#8217;s an app for that. There&#8217;s another problem. If Apple gets a hold of the technology then you sight will be owned by Apple. I&#8217;ve been running OS X since Leopard and I do not like the way they are closing their system. imagine if your sight was dominated by the same people that think they know what the consumer wants and forces it on them by ramming them up theâ€¦

I wouldn&#8217;t mind the technology if it were in the form of a contact lens. I have astigmatism anyway so it would be a win-win. There is still the problem with the fact that it would need access to your brain (It&#8217;s just a theory don&#8217;t ask me how.) to be able to control the interface. That would potentially give someone the power to control you. At least, that is what is shown in the video, but would that really happen. The only brain access it needs is the ability to intercept you eye input and respond to your thought to control it. It doesn&#8217;t need access to another functions of your brain. I&#8217;m not saying I know how the brain works, or that all the brain pulses are connected because I honestly have no idea. With the contact lens it would only be able to intercept your sight, but only display through the contact lens. This would allow the contact lens to be removed and the images being displayed to go away as well.

I don&#8217;t know. Those are just my random ramblings on the matter. I originally wanted to make this post more professional, but I rambled from the beginning. **In the beginning there was a rambler. He rambled and he saw that it was good.**
