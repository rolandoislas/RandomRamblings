On January 18, 2012 many website went offline or censored some content in the effort to stop SOPA. Among these sites were Google, Wikipedia, and even Mojang&#8217;s Minecraft site. Mojang and Wikipedia (English) took it all the way and blocked their entire content. Google on the other hand only censored their logo. They should have done more. If they had censored their search results it may have gotten even more people to join in the fight against SOPA.

Below are the screenshots of the previously mentioned sites:
