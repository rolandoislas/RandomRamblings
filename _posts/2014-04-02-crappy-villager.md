I wanted to create a Crappy Comic involving Minecraft villagers, but two things prevented me from doing so. One, I could not think of something villager related and comic worthy. Two, after realizing how long it took just to draw this one villager (I do spend time drawing these crappy things.) I decided against any more. So, instead of a villager comic, you will get a drawing of a villager. I was inspired to create a villager comic/drawing by Mojangs Aprils Fools day prank to Minecraft players. I welcome you villager overlords and I present this drawing of you as a token of my acceptance.<!--more-->

<del>I think I know why I do not work for Mojang as a graphic artist.</del> Mojang you should definitely employ me as a graphic artist; I already made you the updated villager priest sprite.

For those of you unfamiliar with Minecraft, [go familiarize yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp3yHbluEiY&list=PLxZuR7fx2JOkr-K1fScXxnYIBpCIkHEJ-). For the other who just want a reference to what I was attempting to draw, [here you go](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/File:Priest.png?version=0f1d00bcbcd61560eb9391226cc1c5f3).
