So, Crappy Comics, where to begin? Well, it was 5 in the morning, my phones battery was about to die and I had a laptop nearby. If that doesn&#8217;t shout comic to you then I don&#8217;t know what will. No, the situation was not comical, and looking back, I probably could have just gone to sleep. But no, I had the idea to make a blog and upload a crappy comic Â once in a while. I was thinking of a site layout and what domain I should use. A subdomain? A new TLD? Maybe. You get ambitious at 5 in the morning. I came to my senses and decided that my comics (that will be crappy on most occasions) will live in a category on this blog. Yep. This might be my first and only Crappy Comic or I might just start releasing one every day. Before viewing the &#8220;comic&#8221;, note that I started off with what I thought was a good idea, then came back to it many days later. It&#8217;s also 5 am as I write this and spell check is my friend, but my grammar has gone out the door. Enjoy.
