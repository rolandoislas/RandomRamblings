Cleverbot, the computer program that you can talk to. I have to say I have tried it and it does have its flaws. I spent almost two hours trying to get it to slip up and admit that it was a computer.

From the conversation I started to realize a pattern. It seemed that for a few messages I was talking to a real person and then transferred to a similar going conversation with a different person. By this I mean that there is no actual AI. It is just people taking to each other and constantly getting switched.

To prove this theory I have created a page on my site that explains my theory and has a comments section so that I will know if people can reach it. I have put the url of the page into Cleverbot in the hope that someone will find the page and prove my theory correct.
