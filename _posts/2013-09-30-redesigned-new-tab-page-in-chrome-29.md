Really Google? Was the omnibar too difficult?

Google Chrome 29 introduces a revamped New Tab Page, which looks a lot like the Google&#8217;s homepage with your most browsed sites.

The option to toggle you most viewed websites and apps via links on the side of the page is gone. Instead, a new shortcut has been placed in your bookmarks bar and will take you to the _chrome://apps_ page. Right clicking on the bookmarks bar will give you the option to remove this shorcut.

For those of you looking to bring back the app screen on startup and for the some button, Chrome&#8217;s settings will allow this.  Simply set your startup and homepage to _chrome://apps._

Another change in this update is the relocation of the recent tabs. Previously, one could access recent tabs from the local machine and others connect to the same Google account. Now, the recent tabs con be found in Chrome&#8217;s menu.

Edit: Revert to the previous New Tab page with [instruction from Computerworld](http://blogs.computerworld.com/internet/22878/chrome-new-tab-page "How to switch back to Chrome's old 'New Tab' page").
