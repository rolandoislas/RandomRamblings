I&#8217;m sure all of you have experienced a rainy day. The smell of the rain, the humidity, the sound of the rain falling and wind blowing. I have always enjoyed rainy days, but unfortunately where I live, my rainy day is more like a rainy ten minutes. Thanks to the developers at <a href="http://www.rainymood.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rainymood.com/</a> I can enjoy the rain mood any time I want. Its just the sound an a video background so don&#8217;t get too excited, but it is still pretty cool.
