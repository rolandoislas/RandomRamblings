Ah, a good ol' TF2 update that brings more hats, contracts, bugs, and of course,
 **broken pyros**. Or not.
 
I have seen far too many people complaining on the TF2 casual servers that the
 pyro is broken and such and such should be nerfed, but how many of those people
 have played pyro? Yes, a pyro can do a lot of damage very quickly, but it does
 so at similar levels to other weapons and has a big drawback: the range.
 
Let us not pretend that pyros have massive range. In a close encounter the pyro
 has the advantage, however, other classes have range and/or zoning
 capabilities. If we take a hypothetical corridor with a pyro on one end and
 another class at another, the other class will likely have the range to deal
 with the pyro. A soldier can shoot rockets before the pyro can even come close,
 the demo is laughing at the thought and a heavy is already eating a banana.
 The support classes will have difficulties and have already turned tail and
 promptly scurried back to the safety of their friendly neighborhood ~~yeti~~ 
 heavy.
 
> But what about the projectile reflection!?

Timing! Time those rockets or grenades. Did that airblast just go off? Fire!
 Just like there is more than one cosmetic slot, there is also more than one
 weapon slot. A shotgun in the secondary slot can help with those reflecting
 pyros and do not forget that sticky bombs are more difficult for a pyro to deal
 with.
 
Remember, pyros are your friends that want you to use your `S` key on your
 keyboard and pay more attention to the enemies sneaking around behind you. Do
 not forget to show your Mmmphing pyros a good time by shooting them right as
 they lose their uber.
 
TL;DR: Play better. The DPS stats below show that you are just bad at the game.
