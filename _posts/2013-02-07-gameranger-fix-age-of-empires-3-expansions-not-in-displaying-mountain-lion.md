Those of you that play Age of Empires (AOE) 3 on OS X Mountain Lion and use GameRanger to play online will have probably noticed that GameRanger no longer displays AOE 3&#8217;s expansions. The problem is related to the game plug-ins located in the GameRanger app. Adding a renamed copy of the AOE expansion plug-ins for GameRanger fixes the problem.

The plug-ins can be found at:

> GameRanger.app/Contents/Resources/Plug-ins/Age of Empires III &#8211; The WarChiefs

&

> GameRanger.app/Contents/Resources/Plug-ins/Age of Empires III &#8211; The Asian Dynasties

Simply copy the files and rename then to something other than the original. I have found that only renaming the original files has no effect.

ForÂ convenience, I have created an OS X package installer that will install the renamed files into your GameRanger app.
