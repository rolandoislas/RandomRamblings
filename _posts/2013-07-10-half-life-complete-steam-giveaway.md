Are you ready for another giveaway? No? OK, I&#8217;ll just keep Half-Life Complete for myself and enjoy all the dimension jumping aliens. I am giving away Half-Life Complete through Steamgifts. The last giveaway went smoothly, so this time when I purchased a gift to give away I already knew I would use Steamgifts to do so.

# Game Description

In Half-Life you play as Gordan Freeman a physicist who never utters a word. You take Freeman on a journey out of the Black Mesa Research Facility to escape the aliens that have come from another dimension. Did I mention that you were partly to blame for the aliens&#8217; arrival. Yes, you were experimenting with teleportation and you teleported a multitude of horrible mannered and disgusting creatures to you. Now you must survive with the help of people you meet along the way. This is the main story of Half-Life, but I will list the included games in the Half-Life Complete pack with links to their description. Also the first image of this post links to the [Half-Life Complete store page](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/715/).
